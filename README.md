Akari

## Introduction

This repository is for a final project I completed, Akari, which is similar to sudoku. It uses a MVC design pattern alongside JavaFX in order to create the game. If you've never heard of akari before, I suggest starting by checking out [the akari Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Up_(puzzle)). After you do that, you can find the runnable .jar file, then start playing the game and try to solve a few puzzles.
